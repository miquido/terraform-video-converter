  A solution that will generate adaptive streaming urls for videos uploaded to video-source bucket.
  After conversion, videos will be available under
  module.video-cdn.cf_domain_name/file_name/protocol/file_name.protocol_extension
  ex. https://playground-test-video.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/IMG_6326.mov/AppleHLS1/IMG_6326.m3u8
  Also there will be notifications send on endpoint under vars submit-lambda-notification-webhook and
  complete-lambda-notification-webhook.

  By default the solution will make 3 types of conversion: HLS, DASHIS and mp4. This can be changed by
  modifiying video-source/converter-config-1/job-settings.json file.

  Files should be uploaded to video-source/converter-config-1 and only .mp4, .mpg, .m4v, .mov, .m2ts
  are supported (case sensitive)
